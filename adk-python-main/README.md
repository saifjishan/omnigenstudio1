# Building AI Agent Teams with Google's ADK

This project explores the creation of a team of specialized AI agents using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) that can collectively build new AI agents. The implementation leverages ADK's flexible framework to create a system where each agent focuses on specific aspects of agent development, resulting in a collaborative approach to agent creation.

## Project Overview

Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) is an open-source, model-agnostic, and deployment-agnostic framework for developing and deploying AI agents. This project researches ADK's capabilities and designs a team of specialized AI agents that can work together to build new agents.

## Specialized Agent Roles

The AI agent team consists of five core roles:

1. **Agents Engineer**: Focused on designing different types of agents (LLM, Workflow, Custom)
2. **Tools Engineer**: Specialized in creating and integrating tools that extend agent capabilities
3. **Deployment Engineer**: Responsible for packaging and deploying agents to production
4. **Memory Engineer**: Expert in managing context, state, and cross-session memory
5. **Artifacts Engineer**: Specialized in handling binary data and file management

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Each agent specializes in a specific aspect of agent development
- **Collaborative Workflow**: Agents work together through an orchestration system
- **Self-Improving Potential**: The system can learn from experience to build better agents over time
- **Practical Implementation**: Detailed examples show how the system would work in practice

## Implementation Highlights

The implementation includes:

- Foundation setup with core services
- Detailed implementation for each specialized agent
- Orchestration system for agent collaboration
- Practical examples of building different agent types

## Getting Started

To implement this project, you would need:

1. Google Cloud account with appropriate permissions
2. Python environment with ADK installed (`pip install google-adk`)
3. Appropriate authentication setup for Google services
4. Implementation of the core components as outlined in the implementation approach

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Google's ADK can be used to create an intelligent system where AI agents collaborate to build other AI agents. The modular approach enables specialization and expertise in different aspects of agent development, leading to more sophisticated and capable agent creation.

The architecture provides a foundation for self-improving AI systems that can extend their own capabilities by creating new agents to address novel challenges.
